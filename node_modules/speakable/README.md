# node-speakable

Demo video on what you can achieve using node-speakable: https://my.doctape.com/s/NLHn1z

## Description

**node-speakable** is a continuous speech recognition module for node.js.

Basically, **node-speakable** is continuous waiting for you to say something and waits until you finally stopped talking. It then emits an ```speechResult``` event with an ```Array()``` including of your ```recognizedWords```. You can then ```.indexOf()``` the array to trigger some awesome action to happen, like turning on your ```Philips Hue``` lights.

If you ever talked to your XBOX360 (kinect) you're already familiar on how a continuous speech recognition system works for you.

## How

It's pure JavaScript magic... Ok, not yet! Currently node-speakable needs you to __put a binary of ```sox```__ into the modules (into lib) folder to do the recording. The actual voice recognition is then achieved trough a POST to the the Google Speech API.

## Example usage (node example.js)

```javascript
var Speakable = require('./');

var speakable = new Speakable();
```
By default, the language is American English ( 'en-US' ), but you can specify another language in the options.
Example usage:
```javascript
var speakable = new Speakable({lang: 'it-IT'});
```

```javascript
speakable.on('speechStart', function() {
  console.log('onSpeechStart');
});

speakable.on('speechStop', function() {
  console.log('onSpeechStop');
});

speakable.on('speechReady', function() {
  console.log('onSpeechReady');
});

speakable.on('error', function(err) {
  console.log('onError:');
  console.log(err);
  speakable.recordVoice();
});

speakable.on('speechResult', function(recognizedWords) {
  console.log('onSpeechResult:')
  console.log(recognizedWords);
  speakable.recordVoice();
});

speakable.recordVoice();
```

## Todo / Ideas

* Allow overwrite of speakableâ€™s defaults (sox path & parameters, etc.)
* Limit maximum listening time
